approach this problem as if you are a principal data scientist at a top tech company like Amazon, and have your masters degree in both computer science and statistics. I am trying to build a codebase that automatically builds machine learning models for a dataset provided by a user. I want to be able to provide a filename and the code does the rest, utilizing dask and numpy for data processing, ray and optuna and a variety of different GLM and GBM and deep learning models for model trainings, matplotlib and seaborn for model performance and evaluation, and anything else that seems necessary to accomplish this task.
