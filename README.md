# Stock Market Loss Aversion Analysis

## Project Overview

This research investigates loss aversion in financial markets through quantitative analysis of stock market data. Loss aversion, a cornerstone of behavioral economics established by Kahneman and Tversky (1979), suggests that people weigh losses more heavily than equivalent gains. This project seeks to identify and measure this phenomenon in stock market behavior using high-frequency trading data.

## Research Questions and Hypotheses

### Primary Research Questions

1. **Volume Response Asymmetry**
   - H1: Trading volumes increase significantly more following losses than equivalent gains
   - Metrics:
     - Ratio of post-loss to post-gain trading volumes
     - Time decay of volume response
     - Control for market-wide volume trends
   - Methodology:
     - Event study analysis around gain/loss events
     - Matched-pairs analysis of equivalent gain/loss magnitudes
     - Volume normalization using market-wide trading activity

2. **Price Momentum Asymmetry**
   - H2: Price recoveries after losses show different patterns than price continuation after gains
   - Metrics:
     - Return autocorrelation following gains vs losses
     - Duration of momentum effects
     - Probability of trend reversal
   - Methodology:
     - Time series analysis of post-event returns
     - Conditional probability analysis
     - Control for market factors using Fama-French factors

3. **Magnitude Effects**
   - H3: Loss aversion effects increase non-linearly with the magnitude of losses
   - Metrics:
     - Volume response curve across different loss sizes
     - Price impact relative to loss magnitude
     - Trading frequency changes
   - Methodology:
     - Regression analysis with polynomial terms
     - Threshold analysis for behavioral breaks
     - Quantile regression for tail events

4. **Sector-Specific Patterns**
   - H4: Loss aversion patterns vary systematically across market sectors
   - Metrics:
     - Sector-specific loss aversion coefficients
     - Cross-sector correlation of responses
     - Sector volatility influence
   - Methodology:
     - Panel regression with sector fixed effects
     - Industry classification analysis
     - Control for sector-specific risk factors

### Secondary Research Questions

5. **Temporal Stability**
   - How stable are loss aversion patterns over time?
   - Do they change during market stress periods?

6. **Institutional vs Retail Effects**
   - Do loss aversion patterns differ between retail-heavy and institution-heavy stocks?
   - Can we identify different trading patterns using order size?

## Data Sources and Scope
